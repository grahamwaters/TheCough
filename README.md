# TheCough
A cough counting tool for teachers that gives a daily report of potential exposure to viral contagious illnesses or sickness.
Teachers face an unprecedented level of coughing, sneezing, wheezing, and breathing in close proximity to their students. This tool will help teachers keep track of the number of coughs in their classroom and give them a daily report of potential exposure to viral contagious illnesses or sickness. This tool will also help teachers identify students who may need to be referred to the school nurse for further evaluation.

## The Why
Why did we make this tool? As educators we must protect the children, build our immunity, and remain in commision to teach. This tool will help teachers to stay healthy and keep their students healthy.

## The How
How does it work? The teacher will use a mobile device to record the number of coughs in their classroom. The teacher will then receive a daily report of potential exposure to viral contagious illnesses or sickness. The teacher will also be able to identify students who may need to be referred to the school nurse for further evaluation.
